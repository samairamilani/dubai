             The city is indeed a human-made paradise, embellished with technology, design, architecture, and the unwatchable, highest skyscrapers ever constructed in history. 
             It is the most modern city of this century, adorned with endless landmarks and some of the world-reshaping projects currently in developing stages.</h2>
